								<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to IIIT Hyderabad</h2>
								<br>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Congratulations and welcome to IIIT Hyderabad! On behalf of the Gender Sensitisation Cell at IIIT Hyderabad, we extend a warm welcome to every one of you, both as students and as valued members of our community, which thrives on mutual respect, empathy, and inclusivity.
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									We encourage respectful interactions between all our students, regardless of gender. Friendship and collaboration are not only allowed but expected between men and women. One should speak with others as equals, without assumptions or stereotypes. One should try to create an environment where women feel comfortable to participate without hesitation. The workspaces, classrooms, messes, and labs are shared spaces that should be kept welcoming to all.
								</p>
							
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									While academics are certainly a priority, college is the time of your life to explore, form meaningful relationships, grow as human beings, and learn responsibility and accountability. In these endeavours, however, it is important to recognise the importance of a healthy environment: everyone deserves to feel safe, heard, and respected, regardless of their gender identity or background.
								</p>
							
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									While forming new bonds, try to set, understand, and respect appropriate boundaries. Try to listen and make sure that everyone is comfortable with the conversation, jokes, or even casual interactions. What might seem harmless to you might make someone else feel uncomfortable. If you're not sure, it's always okay to ask! Listen to people's body language as well; they might not always be able to tell you that they're feeling uncomfortable. Anything except a clear enthusiastic "yes!" means a no.
								</p>
							
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									IIIT also has a formal process to register gender grievances. All complaints made to the Gender Grievance Cell are investigated seriously and with utmost confidentiality. There is zero tolerance for harassment or inappropriate conduct. Strict disciplinary action is taken as per institute policies.
								</p>
							
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Our campus is home to diverse people, and we strive to make it safe for each and every one of us. You may encounter perspectives and experiences different to those you have been accustomed to. We encourage you to embrace this diversity with an open and accepting mind. Make small conscious efforts to create a safer environment, be it by changing the way we address one another, how we listen, or how we choose our words and actions.
								</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									We are always here for you, whether you have questions, want guidance, or want to discuss something in confidence. We also organise sessions throughout the year to promote a better understanding of gender sensitivity. Our doors (and inboxes!) are always open! We look forward to having you on campus and making college a safer and more positive experience for everyone!
								</p>

								<!-- <h2>To Prospective Students and Parents of IIIT-H</h2>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Congratulations on your academic achievements and thank you for your interest in International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad. IIIT-H is a different institution; I want to briefly explain our core philosophy as you prepare to fill your choices for the Phase II of our admissions.</p>
                                <p>The primary objective of education at IIIT-H, Hyderabad is to impart a <b style="font-weight: bold;">mature world-view</b> and a *long-term vision* to the students.  We do not merely transmit technical skills or scientific knowledge. Providing skills for a high-profile first job after the course of study is definitely not institute's only objective.</p>
                                <p>Let’s consider the skill of driving a car. Efficient driving (spending less fuel, reducing wear-and-tear) needs a deep understanding of the scientific and engineering principles that govern automobiles. While the skill and the knowledge are important, neither will help you choose the right destination for your journey. We want you as a student of IIIT-H to acquire a world-view that helps you choose the destination that is *most fulfilling to you*, in addition to the skills and scientific understanding.</p>
                                <p>IIIT-H, Hyderabad is a research university. It has been rated among top technology schools of the country by different sources, notably as the #3 technology school in India by Dataquest from 2012 onwards. However, we measure our success in terms of the research done at the institute and take pride in the impact we have on the society. Faculty and students at the institute work on several innovative technologies with large potential. These include language translation, speech recognition and synthesis, robotics, data mining, computer vision, VLSI, communications, information security, structural safety, energy-efficient building, computer-aided drug-design, etc.</p>
                                <p>IIIT-H provides a research option to the BTech students from the very beginning. Those opting for research get a B.Tech (Honours) degree in 4 years, and can opt for an MS by Research degrees in 5 years. UG research is an integral element of our design. Over a dozen top-class publications emerge from IIIT-H with undergraduate co-authors every year.</p>
                                <p>The ability to solve unstructured and unseen problems is essential to do well in a fast-changing world of tomorrow.  Students keen to be researchers and product designers should consider our <b style="font-weight: bold;">dual-Degree programmes</b>.</p>		
                                        <p>We have dual degree programmes that link Computer Science with domains like Natural Sciences, Linguistics, and Humanities. Computing is an enabling discipline and can produce great impact when combined with other areas.</p>
                                <p>We have an atmosphere at the Institute that promotes extra-curricular activities and deep introspection. We have a highly acclaimed course on Human Values to tempt students to contemplate on their roles in life broadly.Our true goal is often to impact the society deeply; the immediate concerns about comforts are very minor in comparison. Each of you will have your own ideas about what *your own* impact should be. We want you to find your own way, without any pressure from outside.</p>
                                <p>Financial Assistance is given to those in need at IIIT-H. Bank loans are available easily to those enrolled at IIIT-H. In addition, IIIT-H Special Financial Scheme (ISFAS) is available to needy students, facilitated by donations from our alumni.</p>
                        
                                <p>If you long for a significant impact on the world through technology, then IIIT-H is the right institute for you. While studying at IIIT-H you’ll be expected to work hard, have a true aptitude in the subject area, and possess the right attitude. If a deep commitment towards creating new ideas is your cup of tea, stride boldly through our portals for an exciting and fruitful journey.</p>
