                                                                <p>First off—huge congratulations on making it through the whirlwind of 11th and 12th grade! We know it was no cakewalk: exams, entrance stress, college seat drama, ranks—it's a lot. But guess what? You made it! And now, welcome to college life—a whole new chapter full of discovery and growth. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>You're no longer in the race to get in. You are in. This is your time to breathe, explore, and discover what truly makes you you. IIIT Hyderabad isn't easy—it's intense, unpredictable, and pushes you out of your comfort zone. But like steel forged in fire, it's these very challenges that shape you into someone stronger, sharper, and ready to take on the world. </p>

Follow your curiosity and your decisions, not someone else's shadow. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>And hey, join the madness! Whether or not you officially join a club, attend their events. Play a sport. Try that weird-but-fun-sounding game night. Dance like no one's watching (because seriously, no one is). Sing, code, build, act, paint, volunteer—whatever catches your eye. College is the one place where you get to try it all without fear or judgment. Don't waste that freedom. </p>

I stepped out of my comfort zone, met people from all walks of life, made amazing friends, and grew in ways I never imagined. I've come out of this journey more confident, more curious, and with a tribe I'll keep for life. </p>

It's no small thing you've cracked one of the toughest exams, and you're now part of something truly special.🩷 </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>I know stepping in can feel overwhelming.... New place, new faces, and suddenly everyone around seems super smart. But trust me you'll find your flow🙃.The transition may look scary, but it's honestly smoother than you'd expect.... You'll slowly figure things out, and when you look back after a year, you'll be surprised at how far you've come. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>If you ask me what IIITH has given me, I'd say everything. I've seen such a huge change in myself from someone unsure about the future to someone who found direction, confidence, and a bunch of crazy stories along the way. This place pushes you, yes, but it also helps you discover who you are beyond marks and ranks. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>So my advice? Dive in... Join all the clubs that even slightly interest you whether it's dance, art, music, or something specific like Skateboarding. Talk to people, your batchmates, your seniors, everyone. The more you interact, the more you'll grow. Seniors especially are super chill and helpful, we've all been through the same confusion, and most of us are happy to help (some even love it a little too much 😛). </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>Academically, IIITH gives you tons of freedom. Don't rush. Take time to figure out what you enjoy whether it's research, development, or something else entirely. And while you're figuring it all out, one thing that almost every IIITian will scream from rooftops: start coding early. It's not just about being ahead it's about getting comfortable and confident in your basics(that doesn't mean u start right now you can start after your curriculum starts). </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>You'll also meet people from across the country literally, Jammu to Kanyakumari and from different walks of life. It's amazing how diverse the community is. You'll end up learning more from your peers than you expect. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>And yeah, a wonderful body APEX is there for everything academics, mental health, help with profs or courses, or even just someone to talk to when you're panicking before a deadline. Don't hesitate to reach out them. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>One more thing don't overthink or worry about being judged. Everyone's on their own path. No one has it all figured out, even if they look like they do. You belong here just as much as anyone else. So stop doubting, and start exploring. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>Also… might as well start preparing for the unofficial IIITH lifestyle late nights, last-minute submissions, and bonding over broken code. You'll find yourself writing code at 2 AM while also arguing over random college mails. These random, chaotic moments are what make the best memories. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>And in all of this, don't forget the most important part that is to have fun. Make great friends, build crazy things, fail fast, laugh harder, and enjoy this beautiful chaos. Clubs are one of the best ways to make those friendships so go all in. </p>

Try everything. This place has no ceilings only launchpads. </p>

A bigger congratulations for getting through the last two years - which I feel are the most unnecessarily stressful two years a person can go through. You've made it and have no idea what's coming next? Honestly, same. So what can YOU do next? </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>The first thing I'll say is join clubs and meet all sorts of people. Basically, make friends. I remember participating in several clubs and trying out different things just because I felt bored. I met some of my closest friends through clubs and these events, and I honestly don't think I would have survived the last 5 years without them. From pulling all-nighters on some very annoying assignments to some crazy group trips, I am very sure you'll make some cherished memories. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>I will admit that being in IIIT comes with its pros and cons. This is a fairly academically rigorous institution, and it comes with certain expectations. I also feel that traits like independence and curiosity are valued here. Don't worry, though - once you navigate through everything, I am sure you will find yourself more confident and ready than ever before. Some advice I'll give here - try to prioritise the things that make you happy. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>When it comes to the myriad of opportunities IIIT has to offer, it still boggles my mind. You will find people who are interested in different things - from ICPC world finalists (don't worry, I still don't know its full form) to Chelsea fans (me). My degree is a great example of the unique kind of thinking that happens here. Having just memorised dates and names for my CBSE history, I honestly looked down at the social sciences in general. It was after coming here, I realised how tunnelled my vision was. Taking a sociological perspective on law using computational tools (whew!) was something I never thought I'd do in my wildest dreams. So I definitely recommend that you step outside your comfort zone and try out the most random things just in case you find your niche. </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>Having said all this, I must admit that I still feel like an impostor who's pretending to be smart amongst these super-brilliant people and waiting to be caught. But let me tell you the philosophy I'm following - fake it till you make it. And I think it's working out for me. So don't worry, you're not alone in this journey and just know - you deserve it! Welcome once again! </p>

New beginnings deserve celebration, so cut yourself some slack and get out there, involve as much as possible in all the induction activities, meet new people, and take the beginning few months as an opportunity to come out of your nest and mingle and network, because at the end of this journey, you will have made a family away from home, here in this cozy community. Remember that it is always your friends, juniors, and especially seniors of this close-knit community who are going to be there at every step, helping you out and supporting you. </p>

I still remember my first year where I wanted to be a part of as many clubs and councils as possible, which made me feel more inclusive and I made many connections within a short span of time. After a year, once I understood my interests and figured out how much co-curricular load I could take along with academics, I prioritized few clubs. Whether it was being the coordinator of the dance crew, a part of the felicity team, or a house captain, each post taught me life and social skills, responsibility and leadership, which only academics could never teach. I equipped loads of skills and made a ton of memories by participating in as many cultural events as possible. So, never refrain from getting out of your comfort zone and trying new things, because if not now, in this campus of extremely supportive people and amidst a bunch of opportunities, then you are going to miss out on a lot of stuff. </p>

So, make as many memories as possible because at the end, when you go back into your memory lane, it is these moments that it will be flooded with. </p>

While these may hold value, success isn't just about ticking off predetermined boxes. After JEE, it's time to expand your perspective and to grow beyond that mindset. Time, during your next 4-5 years here, will be your most precious resource. Use it wisely. </p>

                                                                Congrats on being freed from the chains of hyperbola equations and long carbon chains. You must be anxious about joining a new place of study, living far from home. But soon you will be drowning with things to do, clubs to join, lectures to attend, opportunities to prove yourself at, problems that you need to solve (running at times also works).
                                                                </p>
                                                                
                                                                <p>Your life at this college is surely going to be an adventure. You’ll have lots of tales at the end. But for now, go dive into whatever you feel like exploring. From coding to skateboarding, from debates to dance, from escaping on trips with your friends to being a part-time researcher. I put myself into whatever I felt like trying; Felicity, Honors, Apex, OSDG, visiting other colleges and a lot more. While the academics at IIIT are infamous, you will later realise what they train you for. A good balance of fun and acads are needed to survive this college :p.

                                                                <p>The only advice I have for you: Go be an extrovert. It’s a small community but contains great diverse set of people (all aces in their own way if you would take my advice). Make friends, don’t be stuck in your room or in front of your laptops, interact with your seniors (who are going to be your TAs :D). Now that I am writing this while being weeks away from my convocation, I will not change a thing about those 4 years. It really did change me as a person, had a lot of fun and learned a bunch of things along the way.

                        <p>I understand that many of you might feel as confused and overwhelmed as I did when I first joined this institution. For the past two years (or more), most of us had been aiming for an exam and chasing things like a “high package” without any idea on how we plan on achieving them. Your primary aim, however, much like mine was four years ago, is likely to make yourself and your parents proud and trust me, by the time you graduate from IIIT Hyderabad, you will have achieved that and much more.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The one advice that could help you make the most of your time here: TALK. Engage with as many people as you can – your batchmates, juniors, and especially your seniors. A great way to do that is to be a part of as many communities as you can, I got to interact with so many of my seniors and juniors by being part of Apex, The Dance Crew, Felicity or as a House captain. All these experiences contributed significantly to my journey.

                        <p>Beyond the academic and career opportunities, you will create countless cherished memories, from your fresher’s night to your farewell. I will never forget the times I spent pulling all-nighters before quizzes, having maggi at BBC after labs, late-night dance practices and walks, and of course enjoying biryani with my friends. This college will give you so many opportunities to pave your own way and accomplish anything. Learn about the various career possibilities that are out there and discover what truly suits you.
                        </p>

                        <p>Hey guys,
                        Congrats on making it to IIIT! You are stepping into an exciting new chapter of your life :D
                        When I first came to campus, everything felt new and overwhelming, even though I was already in my 2nd year at the time (consequences of covid). We had to do all the networking and interactions online, but you guys are incredibly lucky! To be able to meet and make new connections in person is an experience to cherish. It’s a vast arena of opportunities, so make the best of what’s available to you. Some of the bonds you make now last a lifetime, and I am grateful to IIIT for giving me my amazing friends.
                        </p>

                        <p>One of my best decisions was to get involved in campus activities early on. Whether it’s joining clubs, sports teams, or student organizations, getting involved helps you meet new people and find your community. It’s the best way to interact with seniors and develop valuable new skills.
                        </p>

                        <p>IIIT, in general, demands a high level of independence and self-discipline in academics. Hence, it’s crucial that you effectively manage your time. Don’t fret, though. It’s a good opportunity to evaluate your strengths and interests, so set your priorities accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <p>While academics are important, remember to balance your studies with social activities and self-care. Make time for hobbies, exercise, and relaxation. I have so many fond memories of hanging out with my friends at the various canteens in IIIT, whether in the morning or late at night. These moments of relaxation and social interaction are just as important as your academic achievements.
                        </p>

                        <p>This might sound cliché, but the entire 4 years just flew past in an instant. Looking back at it, there are so many moments I hold dear. Though my journey had its fair share of failures and setbacks, I am thankful for those experiences. They, along with the support I received, helped me become a more resilient and determined person.
                        </p>

                        <p>As you embark on this incredible journey, remember to embrace every moment, both the highs and the lows. Each experience contributes to your personal growth and shapes your future. Take full advantage of the opportunities available to you, build lasting relationships, and strive to find a balance between academics and personal well-being.
                        </p>

                        Just a few years ago, I was in your shoes, filled with curiosity and a touch of anxiety about what college life would hold.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>I remember my first week vividly—being the first COVID batch, I was super scared and anxious about how I was going to interact with people and make friends. The uncertainty of virtual classes and the lack of physical presence seemed daunting. However, the warmth and support of my peers and mentors quickly bridged the gap. We connected through virtual study groups, online clubs, and social media, and despite the distance, I soon felt at home with a welcoming group.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Academics here can be demanding, but they're also incredibly rewarding. Approach your studies with discipline and diligence, and you'll soon realize that it maybe isn't so difficult. Beyond the classroom, IIIT-H offers a plethora of opportunities to explore your interests, be it through coding clubs, sports, cultural events, research projects, or entrepreneurial ventures. There's something for everyone, and you're encouraged to dive in and discover what excites you.

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Step out of your comfort zone and try new things. Go kick a football for the first time, string a guitar for the first time, or join a club that piques your interest. Embrace every opportunity to learn and grow, because college is the perfect place to discover new passions and create unforgettable memories. Take risks, make friends, and enjoy every moment of this amazing journey!

                        Congratulations on getting an admission into this college after all your hardwork and those painful exams. Entering from school to college is one of the biggest transitions we all make. Exactly one year ago, when I was looking at the same website, I was extremely curious and puzzled about what college had in store for me.

                            On the day of registration, I walked in with a myriad of questions in mind. But within a week, I stopped feeling lonely and had made so many friends on campus. This place where you're going to stay for the next couple of years has a charm of its own. So, for those of you who will be staying away from home for the first time, you can trust me when I say you'll find a new home here with a family of amazing peers and seniors.
