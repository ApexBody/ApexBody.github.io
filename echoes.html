<p>Taking up a dual degree course with an unheard of MS speciality was perhaps the moment where I decided to cut off from the herd. CND at IIIT is a unique attempt to bridge the amalgamation of Applied Sciences and Computer Science. Aimed at making engineers well versed in the field of biomolecules, theoretical physics and various other domains, CND is a great place for a curious mind.
</p>

<p>IIIT has been a resourceful cradle for development on a lot of fronts. With a small community I have been able to be a part of various clubs apart from having started one of my own. My experience with IIIT has been laced with a lot of opportunities with a great location in the heart of the city. While there have been troughs through this overwhelming journey and the course has demanded some rigorous hours to be put in, I have definitely been blessed with a broader vision for things.
</p>

<p>At the end of it all, college will be a universe in itself which will be a great chance for you to follow your instincts and shape yourself as the curriculum develops you academically. You will make buddies for life, learn things you’d least expect and fill up the storyboard of your life.
</p>

<p>From an optimist's viewpoint the administration will really prepare its pupils for work, your life will become your own along with your choices, and adventures will no longer be limited to ships, magic and pirates.
</p>


<p>P.S. Collect friends as your crowning jewels.

		<p>Hey buddy! </p>

<p>
Congratulations on getting an admission into this college after all your hardwork and those painful exams. Entering from school to college is one of the biggest transitions we all make. Exactly one year ago, when I was looking at the same website, I was extremely curious and puzzled about what college had in store for me.
</p>

<p>
	On the day of registration, I walked in with a myriad of questions in mind. But within a week, I stopped feeling lonely and had made so many friends on campus. This place where you're going to stay for the next couple of years has a charm of its own. So, for those of you who will be staying away from home for the first time, you can trust me when I say you'll find a new home here with a family of amazing peers and seniors.
</p>

<p>
	Though academics might look stressful in the beginning, you'll fit in the groove as long as you're enthusiastic to learn. Explore different activities with an open mind. Finally, welcome to this place which will witness you improve and grow as a student and person.

		<p>Welcome to IIIT-H!</p>

<p>Amidst difficult times of counselling, I chose IIIT-H because of its emphasis on research. Not only has IIIT-H offered me opportunities that I had never thought of, but also it has moulded me into a responsible and confident person that I am now.</p>

<p>First few months were like an adventure, where you make a ton of friends with your batchmates and seniors, try new and different things you never dreamt of, follow your instincts, find your passions and make your own everlasting memories. From infinite assignments to never ending exams, from sleeping during lectures to working all night for Felicity, IIIT-H has taught me to learn from everything. It has taught me that I can pursue whatever I believe in, if I  try hard enough. It has taught me that Google has solution to every problem. :P </p>

<p>Been a part Social Media Team, Alumni Cell and Felicity, I have learnt that college offers ample opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities as well as those which help one build his/her personality. These past two years have been filled with many ups and downs but the most important thing one learn at IIIT-H is to “Never give up”. </p>

<p>We all have with us our set of dreams and this is the time to break free your cages and chase your dreams. I wish you happy 4/5 years(or more ;) ) of your life at IIIT-H and I hope you and me will make next Felicity, the best ever!
Welcome to the family.</p>

			<p>I joined IIIT Hyderabad through Olympiad mode. I chose IIIT Hyderabad over an equal, if not better option, as it offered both theoretical and practical Computer Science courses and better placement opportunities. After 4 years, I don’t regret my decision.
</p>

	<p>Due to its excellent course structure, students are introduced to different aspects of computer science in first two years and get to work on an interesting research problem of their choice in later years. This enables them to work on challenging engineering problems in their career. The strong foundation provided by the course structure helped me bag an internship at Facebook London.</p>

	<p>Some of the best experiences for me in IIIT include participating in ACM ICPC, wherein I got the chance to travel to China and USA to compete against some of the best universities of the world in a programming competition.</p>

	<p>Another thing which I thoroughly enjoyed was being a teaching assistant in my 3rd and 4th year. It involved designing assignments for first year students and taking tutorials. This helped me in improving confidence and also made me more responsible.
</p>

	<p>Along with computer science, IIIT also gives emphasis to humanities courses. You also get to interact with people from different parts of the country and get to learn about their culture. All these things have broadened my views about life and have turned me into a better person.
</p>

<p>If you want to learn new things and are ready to work hard, you are at the right place!</p>

<p>When I walked into this college, I was a bundle of emotions. Scared, confused and excited, all at the same time. Soon, I met my batchmates, seniors, and it has been a rollercoaster ride ever since.</p>

<p>After getting over the initial shock of how different college is from school, ( or our coaching days ;) ), it amazed me to see the diverse and awesome set of people I found here. Coders, dancers, developers, musicians, bookworms, athletes, just about everybody has something great to offer.</p>

<p>The curriculum of CLD is pretty similar to CSE barring a few courses. It gives a perfect blend of computer sciences and working with language technologies. Working with the intricacies of Indian languages and dealing with them computationally is an upcoming field which fascinates me. While the workload may be heavier than you might expect, you’ll find yourself being surprised at every little detail you notice in a language you thought you knew for your whole life!</p>

<p>College is the time when we come out of our shells and try out all the activities and hobbies we had left behind. IIIT-H gives us an ample amount of opportunities to participate in cultural events throughout the year. Even better, we are encouraged to start something of our own ,may it be a club or an event, if we are truly interested. Be it inter house competitions, helping out with the college fest, hackathons, there is something for everyone!</p>

<p>Going to college is as much about finding out who you really are as it is about getting that degree. Explore, learn, work, and most importantly, have fun! Welcome to IIIT!</p>

<p>Welcome to IIIT-H!</p>

<p>After countless gruesome days of preparing for JEE, SAT etc., you are finally about to enter college. After my 12th class, I had to take a decision between joining the prestigious IIT’s and IIIT-H. Many people advised me to choose the former but I chose the latter because of my interest in computer science, and have never regretted the decision. </p>

<p>College although a challenging experience, is one of the best, that teaches you a lot of things. Here you will learn to take full ownership of your time, responsibilities and who you want to become.
</p>

<p>IIIT is one place which provides one with a lot of wonderful opportunities. You can be a great coder, or the artist you always wanted to become, or the dancer whose videos you watched on Youtube. Yes, you can do all of this, but it is you who would have to break out of the shell of shyness and take the step forward. This is precisely why initial days of college are the most important. I learnt it the hard way. </p>

<p>I believed that academics are the most important part of college life and was hesitant to take part in events that happened initially. Soon i realised that academics will be there throughout your college life. What will not come again are these opportunities. I joined the students parliament in my 2nd year. Through this platform, I got a chance to experience college in a strikingly different way.  So don't make the mistake of sitting in your rooms, missing the chance to make some life-lasting memories and regretting later.</p>

<p> People always say that you need to study only in school and chill during the college life but sadly this isn’t true. You will always have academics to handle, attendance to take care of, assignments to submit , ICPC or GSOC to crack, papers to publish and what not. Pursue your interests and give your best to anything you do. Interact with seniors, ask for help and guidance as they were also at the same stage and will be happy to help you.</p>
<p> Have fun, work hard, make memories.

<p>Hello folks! You’ve come to start a new journey! Guess what- You’ll probably love IIIT-H!
To give you a peek into what waits ahead - You are free from the shackles of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Dive into Comp. Sci.! Follow your passions! </p>

<p>I was really passionate about research when I joined in. In IIIT-H, we get a lot of freedom.
Yes! Explore your passions. I used to sit in random interesting lectures whenever I wanted to!
I got to learn, I got to explore the R and D Labs! I could do what I’ve been waiting for, finally! </p>

<p>The first year for me was exciting and a bit frightening. Frightened of the consequences of living one heck of a life. By not being told what should I study anymore - I was, and you are free to explore Linguistics, Economics, Electronics and much more! </p>

<p>The consequences of following your passions are indeed breath-taking!
Awesome friends, amazing time and even a few research paper in an international conference!
Want to try out Entrepreneurship? Go ahead!
Coding? Go ahead!
Web Development? Go ahead!
Opportunities are limitless, my friend!</p>


<p>Also, remember in your pursuit, the sayings of the wise- “With great freedom comes great responsibility”. The institute offers you some core courses that you ought to know well.
Tip: Master them! They’re essential in the long run. Do your assignments!
No, not on paper! Welcome to the evil OJ! You’ll know what that is, soon enough. :D </p>

<p>Make friends with your batchmates and seniors. They’re going to be some of your best buddies for the next few years, at least. Being a small but closely-knit community, everyone knows everyone - Juniors and seniors alike. They’ll help you in your moving past your hurdles, they’ll celebrate with you in your success!</p>

<p>Now is the time, my friends! Shed all the past fears, break from the shackl</p>

<p>Congratulations on making it to IIIT!</p>

<p>You’re entering a brand new phase of life. So, welcome! When I look back at my journey, I see a bag full of excitement. When I joined IIIT, I was both excited and nervous. Excited since I had heard so much about the amazing academics of IIIT (the so called “coding culture”) . Nervous because, I had heard very little about the cultural scene. :P I was totally into music and wanted to explore it during my time at college.
</p>

<p>Sadly, there was no “Music Club” on campus when I joined (2014). In my second year I took the responsibility to bring an active music culture to college. And guess what! When I graduated, music club was one of the most active clubs of IIIT. From sleepless nights before November Jam to blissful evenings of IIIT Unplugged, my time at IIIT couldn’t have been more musical! Not just music, I feel so lucky to be a part of the enthusiastic Art of Living group of Volunteers on campus. It’s like a closely knit family which organizes a lot of amazing workshops!
</p>

<p>That is the beauty of IIIT, it gives you a good deal of freedom to create, grow, explore, excel! Be as involved and innovative during your time here. Explore new things (and if they don’t exist, create them!). Join clubs. Code. And most importantly have fun!
</p>

<p>Have an amazing time at IIIT! :D</p>

<p>Passed the meticulous security guards, walked through the intermittently lit  hostel corridor, and caught a glimpse of ever so many parents and students on my floor. I remember grudgingly going to the Orientation Day and listening to so many professors speak on the on goings of our college IIIT-H. We were assigned mentors from the second year to interact with us and help us get through our first days of college easily. I made 2 new friends that day and it was just the start!</p>

<p>Now let’s go two months down the lane. The guards knew me by name, and hostel felt like home; although I went home almost every weekend( mum missed me xD) I couldn’t wait to get back to college. In two months I made the best of friends and college became my second home! The frequent “meetings” we had in our balcony where we talked about our seniors who we interacted with were memories I will not forget. And then preparations for the Freshers cultural programme began. I met so many people, made so many friends – batchmates and seniors! But, there’s the academic pressure. Academics is most definitely a quintessential part of IIIT-H; I’m not going to lie to you about that. But, it’s very important for you to know, as juniors, that participating in extra curricular activities is equally important for you to grow in this university. And if you put your mind to it, you can divide time for both.</p>

<p>IIIT-H gives you opportunities for you to explore yourself. I have friends who never thought they could dance or sing so well before performing on stage. Our schooling might have been stringent but our college gives you so much freedom(yes, we have no curfew!) to do so much more. Let me remind you this, get to know all the clubs in our college. You’ll be surprised to know how many we have and never hesitate to participate in any!</p>

<p>So come out of your comfy shells, explore, make friends, learn, leave no stone unturned and have loads of fun, juniors! A hearty welcome to y’all! </p>

<p>Welcome to IIIT!</p>

<p>It still feels unreal that an year has passed since my first day here, I remember all of it, the
nerves, and the awkward small talk with people who were strangers back then, and are
comrades now. The first few days are an adventure, finding new friends in your batchmates,
your seniors, this is the time to follow your passion, let go of your fears, come out of your shell,
and join clubs that interest you! Trust me on this, clubs are an amazing way to build upon your
hobbies and interests.</p>

<p>One important thing that all of you need to understand is that school is over, last couple of years were tough, I know, but it is different now, you do not have a sword hanging above your neck
anymore. You’ve chosen your field, and now is the time to go out, explore it, and master it.</p>

<p>The first year should not just be about your semester courses and programming assignments,
you’ll have enough of that, don’t worry (or do?). I would rather encourage you all to explore our
labs, use IIIT for what it’s renowned. We have some of the best researchers in our country
developing technologies that will shape our future, use that proximity to sharpen yourselves,
something or the other will surely interest you, and there is so much to learn. :D</p>

<p>This is it people, the most creative period of your life has just started. Pursue your talents, go for
your dreams, aim for the stars, the world is your oyster today. It’s your college life, you’ll love it,
you’ll hate it, but at the end of it, when you exit that campus gate for the very last time, you’ll be
prepared to take on whatever the world throws at you.</p>

<p>Seize the day.</p>
<p>Also, ask for a chocolate-coffee at the Juice Canteen.</p>
<p>It’s awesome.</p>
