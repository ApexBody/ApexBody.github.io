		<h2>An Informal Introduction To IIIT-H
		<hr>
		<br>
		<p>IIIT-H is a university that provides the quintessential college life.
		The curriculum not only provides the core technical courses required for career oriented endeavors but also focuses on molding the student as a whole by providing life-skills as part of their non technical courses. IIIT-H is known for its ground breaking research, needless to say, a strong emphasis is laid on research oriented knowledge building.
		The research oriented approach helps solve real-life problems and allows students to work on  cutting edge technology to derive the solutions. As the directors, P.J. Narayan likes to say, “IIIT-H prepares not for your first job, but for your last job.”</p>
		<p>The college is efficiently organized into research centers and labs to facilitate inter-disciplinary research and brilliant network for exchange of knowledge and ideas. Here, the curriculum allows flexibility for the student in selecting courses and projects.</p>
		<p>The institute's unique Human Values program at the undergraduate level has already gained attention at national and international levels. The perfect blend of core, science and humanities courses is the recipe for a highly balanced program. The institute offers its students a unique environment that promotes cultural, sports and societal contributions, art, self-governance and human values along with striving for academic excellence. </p>

		<em>Academics</em>

		<p>IIIT-H  has made a mark in various spheres of society, be it through groundbreaking research or the achievements by its alumni, all because of its high academic standard. While the college does provide its students with an excellent and balanced academic environment, it also expects a fairly responsible behavior from them.
		The Undergraduate TA (Teaching Assistant) system here includes students who assist the Lecturer in conducting the course by taking charge of Labs and Tutorials. This system, coupled with the rigor and discipline of IIIT-H, not only helps the students interact better and learn faster, it also helps the TAs themselves to understand the topics better, and gain tutoring experience. Also, the faculty is always visibly open to doubts and ideas from the students.The facuty is ever ready to solve any doubts or questions raised by student community.  The interaction is informal and the professors are easily approachable. Several students have been able to gain from this cooperative interaction, both in academics and personal character.</p>
		<p>At IIIT-H, the academic model allows for greater freedom and flexibility in terms of what you wish to study, but with great powers come great responsibilities. You are given the opportunity to select electives right from your 5th semester, and you decide on the course of education from there on.
		Courses such as Humanities Soft Skills and Science would help in that regard. This also means having a third eye open to look at the bigger picture - and courses from various disciplines of humanities, from polity to economics, classical texts to modern philosophy - should help you widen your horizons.</p>


		<em>Felicity</em>

		<p>Felicity is the annual techno-cultural fest organized by IIIT-H. A three-day long spectacle, it involves a large range of exciting activities, competitions, talks, workshops and stunning performances by bands from all over the country.
		It begins with the Inaugurals, performed by our very own students who put in months of effort to make the show a success. The campus buzzes with excitement as the Kalakshetra team puts a one up on the glamour with beautiful paintings, sculptures and creatives pieces of art.
		From then on, there is something for everyone!</p>
		<p>The different online and offline events organized by students generally include the robotics team for Pulsation; the artists for Kalakshetra; the literary enthusiasts for LitCafe; the gamers for Zombie Zone (with events like Counter-Strike, DotA and FIFA :D) and all of the others join hands to create a wonderful 3-day bonanza. One of the happiest moments in college would be organizing or coordinating a successful event for Felicity.
		Coupled with inspiring talks and stellar band performances, Felicity makes for a truly indelible experience for organizers, participants and audience alike!</p>

		<em>Hostels</em>
		<p>Here at IIIT-H, we have 5 hostels Palash Nivas (OBH), Kadamba Nivas (NBH), Bakul for the boys, Parijat Nivas (GH) and Parul for the girls. The rooms are quite spacious. The hostels also have facilities like washing machines on each floor. There are multiple TV rooms for the usage of students at any time - specially during cricket season!</p>
		<p>OBH and NBH have general stores which sell everyday things required by students. There is a barber shop on campus too, for all your grooming needs. The hostels are also equipped with gyms and indoor sports facilities like TT, Chess and Carrom.
		We at IIIT-H believe in the responsible nature of students, and to facilitate working in the labs, there is no restriction on movement inside campus for anyone at anytime.</p>

		<em>Mess and Canteens</em>
		<p>IIIT-H has a unique blend of 4 messes and students can select where they want to eat, for each meal of the day. With OBH-FF serving North Indian food, OBH-GF serving South Indian food, Yuktahaar serving healthy oil-free food, and NBH serving a mix of both North and South Indian cuisines, all students have a wide variety of choices at their disposal. Also, the Non-Vegetarian Mess is active five days a week.
		The students are expected to register for their meals at least 2 days in advance on the mess portal after referring to the menus for the respective messes.</p>
		<p>Alongside this, the campus has 2 canteens at different locations around campus, each popular for their own specialities. For example, you would soon find yourself very familiar with the famous Juice canteen which is one of the most popular spots for hanging out with friends! Or you could chill out with a sandwich and tea near the basketball court canteen!</p>		

		<em>Campus and Environment</em>
		<p>The campus is spread over a sprawling area of 62 acres. There are four buildings that house the corporate schools and research centers. In addition to this, the academic building has lecture halls, tutorial rooms, computer and electronics labs and offices for the administration and faculty. The buildings are named after the mountain ranges - Nilgiri, Vindhya and Himalaya.</p>
		<p>The Amphitheatre, Juice canteen and the Felicity Ground are common spots around the college for students to enjoy the open air.
		We believe in keeping our campus clean, green and pollution-free. All roads on campus are lined with trees on both sides and there are garbage bins at every corner.</p>
		<p>The climate for the larger part of the year is quite pleasant in Hyderabad. The winters are favorably cool and somedays cold but rarely does the temperature drop below 10° C. The summers are generally hot with the threshold being 35-38 degrees but thankfully, the summer vacations begin just as the weather gets unbearable.</p>

		<em>Clubs</em>

		<p>IIIT-H is a small but diverse community and it's not very difficult to find people who share the same interests as yours. Therefore, there are a number of small clubs formed by enthusiasts who are passionate about the same things. We have clubs ranging from Dance, Quizzing, Literary and Design to Finance, Programming and Open Source Development, all of which hold regular meetings and activities. And the best part is that if you want you can start your own clubs. There are no restrictions and all you need is loads of enthusiasm and passion to build a club of your own.

                <em>House Activities</em>

		<p>Right from your first day, each student is assigned to a house at IIIT-H. There are 4 houses -  Aakash, Agni, Prithvi and Vayu. Each year the houses compete in a year-round competition which involves various cultural and sports activities.</p>
		<p>It starts with the Fresher’s Night where the newcomers in each house put up a cultural show to compete for their house’s glory. The Fresher’s Night also includes Flair, an event which tests the individual participants in all their cultural and character traits, ultimately culminating in the crowning of the coveted titles of Mr. Fresher and Ms. Fresher. </p>
		<p>Later in the year, there are Inter-house competitions like Sports, Music, Acting, Elocution, Art and Crafts, even Informal ones like Antakshari and Dumb Charades. The year-long house activities culminate with the Cultural Night which is a dance competition and a rolling trophy is given to the winning house.  </p>
		<p>Sports in IIIT-H are a year-round phenomena. Throughout the Monsoon semester, you have inter-house sports competitions, in hopes to win the house cup. </p>
		<p>This includes sports like track, kho-kho, basketball, cricket, football, table tennis, volleyball and throwball. Juniors and seniors play on the same team, which leads to great bonds being formed. This takes a turn during Spring semester, where the sports competitions are inter-batch. Batches form their own teams, and this time they play for pride. By the way, the adjacent Gachibowli stadium has Olympic grade swimming facilities and could be availed for a nominal cost by IIIT-H students.</p>
