									<b><font color="black" size="5">Cellphone Connections</font></b><p></p>
									<p>Mobile connections can be availed from Indira Nagar, near IIIT-H campus. One can
									get connections from many cellphone network service providers, like <a href="https://g.co/kgs/5ZZwfaS">Jio</a>,<a href="https://g.co/kgs/wxW2Lzy">Airtel</a>,<a href="https://g.co/kgs/359GvGK">VI</a> etc. <br>
									</p>
									<b><font color="black" size="5">Bank Accounts</font></b>
									<p>
										<p>
										There is a branch of State Bank of India within the campus. It would be at the discretion of your parents or local guardians to open a bank account here. Again, it would be easier if you could bring some documents along with their photocopies and passport-sized photographs from home itself, as it may take time for college shops to provide the necessary documents. Additionally, there is an SBI ATM present on campus.
									</p>
									<p>
										For any bank-related procedure, make sure to check in advance—either from home or by visiting a nearby bank branch—what documents and steps are required for the specific process you plan to complete.
									</p>
									
									<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bank officials will be available on the day of registration for you to avail education loan.</span></p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Branch Manager SBI:</strong> +91 9492877255</li>
										<li><strong>Branch Manager Canara Bank:</strong> +91 9597633780</li>
									</ul>

									<b><font color="black" size="5">Healthcare</font></b>  <p></p>                                  <p>There are multiple outlets of Apollo Pharmacy near campus (<a href="https://g.co/kgs/DjFdkLT">Gachibowli-DLF Road</a>, 
                                    <a href="https://g.co/kgs/MnUDFzP">Kondapur</a>). However, students are advised to bring whichever necessary medicines as per
									their individual needs. First aid kits are present with hostel guards, and an ambulance is available on call.</p>
									<p>
										<p>The campus has a healthcare facility called Aarogya, which is equipped to handle basic medical needs. A nurse is available 24×7 to provide assistance, while doctors—including general physicians, allopathic doctors, and counsellors—are available during specified hours in the daytime.

											In case of emergencies, an ambulance is available on campus to take patients to nearby hospitals and ensure proper care is provided promptly.</p>

									There are multiple hospitals nearby including <a href="https://g.co/kgs/33R13WT">Care Hospital</a>, <a href="https://g.co/kgs/mFEVxdV">ARETE Hospital</a>, and <a href="https://g.co/kgs/aPKuYcF">Himagiri Hospital</a>. Care Hospital and ARETE Hospital provide discounts for IIIT-H students.</p>
									<b><font color="black" size="5">IIITH Intranet</font></b><p> </p>
									<p>
									Many campus services are available only within the IIIT-H intranet. To access these services, you will have to login with your
									student details (which you will be getting soon) in <a href="https://reverseproxy.iiit.ac.in/">https://reverseproxy.iiit.ac.in/</a> , or setup the IIITH VPN at <a href="https://vpn.iiit.ac.in/">https://vpn.iiit.ac.in/</a> (instructions present in the page).
									You can now access internal IIITH facilities, including <a href="https://mess.iiit.ac.in/">https://mess.iiit.ac.in/</a>, which is used for managing your on-campus mess services, 
									<a href="https://intranet.iiit.ac.in/">https://intranet.iiit.ac.in/</a>, which gives general information related to IIITH, among others.
